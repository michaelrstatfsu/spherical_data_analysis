This Matlab Module Builds on a pthon script that I came across in an data science course I took. Basically it grabs twitter data, extracts geographical coordinates, and plots the tweet on the sphere.

A bit of caution when looking a twitter data. Some people who use twitter are morons (for lack of a better word). Sometimes you may see offensive language when analyzing this kind of data.
