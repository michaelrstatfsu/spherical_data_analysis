This Module contains examples of converting pixles from cylindical maps into cartesian coordinates.

The main function is called pix2geo.m

There are three examples which demonstrate how to use the pix2geo function. You should have a directory containing the following maps in Matlab's search path in order to run this experiment.

earth_800.jpg
earth_400.jpg
clouds_9_05_12.jpg
clouds_9_04_12.jpg

One way to do this is to add the Spherical_Regression_Library directory and its subdirectories to the search path.
