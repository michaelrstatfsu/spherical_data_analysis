%% Vectorcardiogram girls age 11 to 19 Example
% This dataset come from Downs, Liebman and Mackay (1971) and can be found 
% at:

% http://www.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~pej/vcg.html
% 
% This data is very well characterized with a rigid rotation. See the link
% for the details. The basics are as follows. The vectorcardiogram is
% contructed through multiple electrocardiogram leads which are 
% placed on the body. They
% measure the electromagnetic field which are generated by heart actions.
% By placing multiple leads, one is able to triangulate the direction and
% magnitude of these electrical fields. If you where to plot these vectors
% over time, what would emerge is a cardiod-like shape. The direction of
% greatest magnitude is a relevent feature which is extract and
% has applications is disease
% diagnostics. This data set consists of measurements of children from two
% different lead systems. The correspondences between these two lead
% systems is of interest for a variety of reasons.
%
% In Downs 2003, an model was proposed using mobius transformation so
% that scaling of variables could be characterized.
