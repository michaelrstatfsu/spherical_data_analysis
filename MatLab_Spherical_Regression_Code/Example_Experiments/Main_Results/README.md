In this folder, these are some examples of analysis performed on different data sets. For details on this data, see my dissertation.

The following function creates a summary table, computes residual diagnostics statistics, and creates plots for the data.
MAIN_Spherical_Regression_Analysis

The functions which build the model all take the same first two arguments X,Y which denote the predictor X and response Y represented as MxN matrices where the columns denote corresponding observations of spherical data on the $\mathbb{S}^{M-1}$ dimensional hypersphere.

* PARAMETRIC MODELS
    * Projective Linear Transformation   
        * **[A,e,Xtilde,path]= PLT_NR(X,Y,noreflect)**
            * **A** is the MxM transformation matrix in SL(M) which parametrizes the projective linear transformation. The MLE for the true transformation matrix is computed using an intrinsic Newton-Raphson algorithm.
            * **Xtilde** is MxN matrix whose columns represent the predicted values of Y given X.
            * **path** is an matrix which stores the iterative path on the sphere as the Xtildes are updated in the algorithm. When M=3, this variable can be passed into the third argument of the Display_Path function to plot the algorithms convergence on the sphere.
        * **[Ahat,e,Xtilde,path]= PLT\_GA(X,Y)**
             * **A** is the MxM transformation matrix in SL(M) which parametrizes the projective linear transformation. The MLE for the true transformation matrix is computed using an intrinsic Gradient Ascent algorithm.
             * **Xtilde** is MxN matrix whose columns represent the predicted values of Y given X.
             * **path** is a matrix which stores the iterative path on the sphere as the Xtildes are updated in the algorithm. When M=3, this variable can be passed into the third argument of the Display_Path function to plot the algorithms convergence on the sphere.
    * Rigid Rotation and Reflection
        * [Ahat,e,Yhat]=RRR(X,Y,noreflect)
    * Parametric Log Linear Regression
        * [Ahat,e,Yhat,Ynew]=LLR(X,Y,Xnew)
* NONPARAMETRIC MEODELS
    * Diffeomorphic Spherical Regression
        * [Grid2,E,Xtilde,path] = NPSR(X,Y,lambda,l,NN)
    * Local Linear Regression
        * [m] = LocalLR(X,Y,Xnew,kappa)
