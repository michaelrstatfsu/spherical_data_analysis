This directory contains the main matlab files used to perform the analysis.

Performance_Evaluation_Tool
This contains automated performance measurements by applying leave-one-out cross validation methods to the data. The final results are output into latex table format for easy reporting.

Regression_Functions 
This contains functions for applying regression models to spherical data in cartesian coordinates.

Sphere_sd_functions
This contains matlab functions which are related to the sphere. It includes retraction mappings for tangent spaces on the hypersphere sphere, plotting tools, and tools for utilizing the von Mises Fisher distribution.

Special_Linear_Group_sld_functions
This contains code for constructing orthonormal bases for the tangent spaces of the special linear group. It also contains code for randomly generating elements of the special linear group.
