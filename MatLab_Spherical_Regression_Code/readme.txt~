    I want to thank my committee members for their guidance, assistance, and patience. I will begin by thanking Dr. Srivastava who has always made time for me and put considerable effort in the development of my research and myself. I am inspired by how well he coordinates the many projects and events that he is involved in. I also want to thank Dr. Wu who has put in considerable effort in the asymptotic analysis results, and who has been helpful and encouraging to me. I don’t know where this project would be without Dr. Klassen, who’s mathematical insights have profoundly shaped the development of this research. I would also like to thank Dr. Pati for his interest and valuable insights. These people have all been excellent mentors to me, and I appreciate there effort and time.

ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Spherical regression explores relationships between pairs of variables on spherical domains. Spherical data has become more prevalent in biological, gaming, geographical, and meteorological investigations, creating a need for tools that analyze such data. Previous works on spherical regression have focused on rigid parametric models or nonparametric kernel smoothing methods. This leaves a huge gap in the available tools with no intermediate options currently available. This work will develop two such intermediate models, one parametric using projective linear transformation and one nonparametric model using diffeomorphic maps from a sphere to itself. The models are estimated in a maximum-likelihood framework using gradient-based optimizations. For the parametric model, an efficient Newton-Raphson algorithm is derived and asymptotic analysis is developed. A first-order roughness penalty is specified for the nonparametric model using the Jacobian of diffeomorphisms. The prediction performance of the proposed models are compared with state-of-the-art methods using simulated and real data involving plate tectonics, cloud deformations, wind, accelerometer, bird migration, and vector-cardiogram data.

Description of Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This repository is intended to assist investigators who are interested in applying the spherical regression models presented in my dissertation manuscript titled, "PARAMETRIC AND NONPARAMETRIC SPHERICAL REGRESSION WITH DIFFEOMORPHISMS." One should refer to that document for details on the methods implementated in this repository. To facilitate in the understanding of the code, the components have been separated into different folders which correspond to different parts of the material outlined in the manuscript. 
    In this main directory, you will find two sub directories.

- Spherical_Regression_Library
    This directory contains a collection of functions which needed for performing spherical regression analysis described in the manuscript. In that fold there are three other directories. For details on those subdirectories see the readme.txt file located in that folder.

- Example_Experiments
    This directory contains a collection of scripts which perform the analysis presented in the manuscript. The Analysis has been split into two separate directories which correspond to results presented in different papers. For details on those subdirectories see the readme.txt file located in that folder.

Getting Started
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To download this repository as a zip file:
(1) Navigate to the following url in your web browser:
https://github.com/michaelrstatfsu/spherical_data_analysis
(2) click on the button that says download zip.
(3) move the downloaded zip file to a desired directory and unzip the folder.

For those who are new to Matlab, in order to run the analysis presented in the Example_Experiments directory, you will need add the function library to your matlab path. To do this, 
(1) open Matlab
(2) navigate to this directory through the 'current folder' tab
(3) right click on this folder and select "selected folder and subfolders" from the "add to path" tab.

Once you have added the MatLab_Spherical_Regression_Code directory and its subdirectories to your matlab path, you can then proceed to explore the Example_Experiments directory.
